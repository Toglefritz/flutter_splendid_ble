/// [SplendidBleCentral] provides an interface to interact with Bluetooth functionalities from a Flutter app acting
/// as a BLE central device.
///
/// This class offers methods to check and monitor the status of the Bluetooth adapter, scan for devices,
/// connect/disconnect to/from devices, and manage Bluetooth permissions. It serves as a bridge to the underlying
/// platform-specific Bluetooth implementation, abstracting the complexity and providing a simple API for Flutter
/// applications.
///
/// The class primarily uses asynchronous patterns like [Future] and [Stream] to provide real-time updates and
/// responses to Bluetooth operations. The methods in this class delegate the actual operations to
/// `FlutterSplendidBlePlatform.instance`, ensuring platform-agnostic behavior.

/// This type is an alias for [SplendidBleCentral] and is used to maintain compatibility with the previous
/// version of the plugin. It is recommended to use [SplendidBleCentral] instead because, when peripheral mode is
/// eventually introduced, the use of [SplendidBleCentral] will be more clear.
